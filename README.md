# PP440 Winter Term Memo 

Instructions:

You have been invited to advise the newly appointed Finance Minister of a country of your
choice. The Finance Minister has a PhD in economics, but has been overseas for the past
decade and hasn’t followed events in her own country. She now needs to be brought up to
speed on the state of the domestic economy. She has asked you to draft a 2-page memo
describing how the economy is doing in its long run and its short run performance [60% of
your mark]. She has also asked you to assess recent inflation in the country and to explain its
causes [40% of your mark].

In responding to the minister, choose three variables that give a good measure of how the
economy is doing. Plot the three variables and explain what the state of this economy is in
both the short run and the long run. It is up to you to decide the appropriate time frame for
“short” and “long” run as this may vary from economy to economy. (Short and long run
reflect the trend and the cycle whose duration differ from country to country.) Depending
on the economy in question, you may be able to visualize the economy’s short and long run
conditions in a single chart, but if necessary you could plot each variable in two separate
figures, reflecting long- and short-run conditions. Note that at this point you are being asked
to describe the state of the economy and how well it is performing, not explain why it is
performing the way it is. You will be judged not only on your choice of variables and
explanation, but also on how clearly your graphs tell the story of the state of the economy.
